## Game RULES

* The game has two players.
* In a single round of the game,
  - each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" — rock, paper, or scissors.
* Then, players reveal their moves at the same time.
* If both players picked the same move, there is no winner.
* Players can play a single round, or "best of three", or any number of other options.

## Important Note

  > rock beats scissors;
  > paper beats rock; and
  > scissors beat paper.
